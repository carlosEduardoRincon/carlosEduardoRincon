<h1>Hi there! I'm Carlos Eduardo Rincon ðŸ‘‹</h1> 

<div>
  <p>
    I work as a systems development analyst at a leading company in the telecommunications market, my main focus is developing and improving APIs, in addition to assisting throughout the entire development process of different projects.
    With a solid foundation in Java, which I have been improving since 2021, I am well prepared to face any project. The combination of my academic training with professional experience has made me a qualified professional to deal with daily challenges.
    As Max Weber said, "Man would not have achieved the possible if he had not, again and again, attempted the impossible." It is in this spirit that I dedicate myself daily to seeking innovative and efficient solutions for the projects I participate in.
