  <p>
    I work as a mid-level backend developer at one of the largest banks in Brazil. My main responsibilities involve the development and optimization of backend systems, where I actively contribute to the development lifecycle.

    As Max Weber said, "Man would not have attained the possible unless time and again he had reached out for the impossible." It is in this spirit that I dedicate myself daily to seeking innovative and efficient solutions for the projects I participate in.
